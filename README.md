# randomTokenGenerator
This is a php generator using multiple hashlibs for the website to create unique and unpredictable (I think) tokens;

You need at least a web server like apache and php to "run" it in your browser,
Just put the index.php in your root file (it depends on your operating system, for linux it's /var/www) then go to your IP address ;
This is not supposed to be run in a php shell, or using php bin. Opening the file in your browser won't work either, you need a server with php.

Anyway, if you are a very good mathematician or someone very knowledgeable about hashing and cryptography, if you find my function dangerous or if it can create a collision, 
please tell me about it.

That's it, thanks for reading and if you use it, I'm not asking for credit but I would appreciate it if you added it.
